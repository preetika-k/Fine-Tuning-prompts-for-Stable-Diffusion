# Fine-Tuning-prompts-for-Stable-Diffusion
As latent text-to image models are developing, it can be diffuclit for non-developers to curate an image to their liking given their little knowledge on correct prompting syntax and key words that thrive in the model.
This code is designed to generate text prompts for Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image AI model. It takes a paragraph of text as input and generates a number of additional prompts for Stable Diffusion, which can then be used to generate realistic images.
The code uses Together.ai's API to correct the paragraph of text and to generate the additional prompts. 



# Prompt vs Image
The tester paragraph was entered without a prompt to allow the model to generate an appropriate prompt based on the preceding code. The second image shows the final prompt being processed through the Stable Diffusion model, which accurately reflects the initial paragraph.
