# Fine-Tuning-prompts-for-Stable-Diffusion

This code is designed to generate text prompts for Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image AI model. It takes a paragraph of text as input and generates a number of additional prompts for Stable Diffusion, which can then be used to generate realistic images.
The code uses Together.ai's API to correct the paragraph of text and to generate the additional prompts.
